<h2>The assertion</h2>
<p>In in article in one of its printed publications, NARAL asserts that “Personhood at conception is a religious belief, not a provable biological fact.”[1]</p>

<p>This argument seeks to justify abortion by claiming that there is no objective, scientific basis for believing that a pre-born baby is an actual person, which means that a pre-born baby does not have any rights, including the right to live.</p>

<h2><a href="#answer-1-top" id="answer-1">^</a> 1. Okay, let’s pretend that we can’t know when life begins. Shouldn’t we err on the side of caution?</h2>

<p>Let’s consider several other scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are driving at night and are not sure if there is a child in the middle of the road in front of you, do you keep driving and risk killing the child or do you stop?</li>
  <li>If you come across a person who is injured and are not sure if he is dead, do you leave him to die, or do you try to help and save him?</li>
  <li>If a hunter is uncertain if movement in the brush is because of a human or an animal, should he risk shooting or should he err on the side of caution?</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let’s ask the same question in regards to abortion: <strong>If we are uncertain if abortion is the killing of an actual human being, should we risk killing a human being or should we err on the side of caution?</strong></p>
