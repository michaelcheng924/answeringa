// It's a fetus/embryo, not a baby

<h2>The assertion</h2>

<p>Some try to justify abortion by claiming that it is merely a fetus or an embryo that is inside the woman, not an actual baby, person, or human being.</p>

<h2>The answer: The terms embryo and fetus simply refer to human beings at a particular stage of development</h2>

<p>The terms "embryo" and "fetus" refer to a human being in an early stage of development. "Fetus" is simply a Latin word that means "offspring," "young one," or "little child." Saying that a fetus is not a human being because the fetus is in an early stage of development is like saying a toddler is not a human being because the toddler is in an early stage of development, which is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Where a human being is in her stage of development has nothing to do with whether she deserves to live. Does an older born human being have more of a right to live than a younger born human being? Everyone would agree that the answer to this is no. So, why would a younger <em>unborn</em> human being have less of a right to live?</p>

<p>Some argue that an unborn human being is different in that an unborn human being:</p>

<ol>
  <li>is completely dependent upon the mother for survival. For a response to this, see Should We be Allowed to Kill Humans who are Dependent upon Others? (IN PROGRESS).</li>
  <li>is still inside the mother. For a response to this, see Should We Discriminate against Humans because of their Location? (IN PROGRESS).</li>
</ol>

<p>Those who use this argument are usually trying to say that the "fetus" is actually not a human being. If this is the case, then see this article: <a href="/answers/life-at-conception" target="_blank">Definitive proof that human life begins at conception and fertilization</a></p>
