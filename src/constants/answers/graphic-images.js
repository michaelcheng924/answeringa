<h2>The argument</h2>

<p>Some argue that graphic images of dead babies should not be used to protest abortion. Supposedly, these graphic images are cruel, emotional attacks.</p>

<p><em>Note: This page heavily utilizes Randy Alcorn's terrific book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Life-Answers-Pro-Choice-Arguments-Expanded/dp/1576737519" target="_blank">Pro-Life Answers to Pro-Choice Questions</a></em>.</p>

<h2>__ answers</h2>

<h3>1. The images are true</h3>

<p>The graphic images of dead babies are not invented or fabricated by anyone. They depict the reality of abortion. This is what feminist Naomi Wolf admits this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To many prochoice advocates, the imagery is revolting propaganda. There is a sense among us, let us be frank, that the grusomeness of the imagery <em>belongs</em> to the prolifers: that it emerges from the dark, frightening minds of fanatics: that it represents the violence of imaginations that would, given half a chance, turn our world into a scary, repressive place. "People like us" see such material as the pornography of the pro-life movement.</p>

<p>But feminism at its best is based on what is simply true. While prolifers have not been beyond dishonesty, distortion and the doctoring of images (preferring, for example, to highlight the results of very late, very rare abortions), many of those photographs are in fact photographs of actual D & Cs; those footprints are in fact the footprints of a 10-week-old fetus; the prolife slogan, "Abortion stops a beating heart," is incontrovertibly true. While images of violent fetal death work magnificently for prolifers as political polemic, the pictures are not polemical in themselves: they are biological facts. We know this.[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One reporter for <em>CBS Evening News</em> responded to a prolife candidate who ran television ads showing aborted babies by saying that the abortion debate had reached a "new low in tastelessness." Similarly, many people were outraged.</p>

<p>However, we should respond to this outrage by asking, "What specifically is 'tasteless' about showing real images of abortion? Are you outraged that babies are being killed?" The showing of these graphic images merely reveals that these things are happening. What specifically is wrong with that?</p>

<p>When a person who is pro-choice responds to these images by saying, "This is sick and horrible," we should respond by saying, "We agree. It's sick and horrible what is being done to these babies."</p>

<p>One radio talk show host was upset that Alcorn's book, <em>Pro-Life Answers</em>, is "filled" with "horrible" pictures of aborted babies (it actually only contains two pictures of aborted babies). Alcorn asked her, "Why are you angry at me? Who do you think killed these babies? Me?" She admitted, "No, I guess it was the doctor." In other words, the person who was the source of these "horrible" images was someone who holds her own pro-choice position.</p>
