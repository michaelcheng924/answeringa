<h2>The assertion</h2>
<p>In in article in one of its printed publications, NARAL asserts that “Personhood at conception is a religious belief, not a provable biological fact.”[1]</p>

<h2>The answer</h2>

<p>The truth is that <strong>science is clear and overwhelmingly consistent in affirming that human life begins at conception and fertilization</strong>.</p>

<p>Below are 15 scientific sources, most of which are secular and non-biased, that teach that life begins at fertilization/conception.</p>

<h2><a href="#answers-2-top" id="answers-2">^</a> Modern texts that teach life begins at conception and fertilization</h2>

<h3>1. Keith L. Moore, <em>The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/cwQH8FA.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote><strong>Human development begins at fertilization</strong>, approximately 14 days after the onset of the last menstrual period… when a sperm fuses with an oocyte to form a single cell, the zygote. <strong>This highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.</strong>[2]</blockquote>

<h3>2. T.W. Sadler, <em>Langman's Medical Embryology, 13th edition</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/ANAth0z.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote><strong>Development begins with fertilization</strong>, the process by which the male gamete, the sperm, and the femal gamete, the oocyte, unite to give rise to a zygote.[3]</blockquote>

<h3>3. Keith L. Moore, <em>Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology, 9th edition</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/zD3oKis.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote><strong>Human development begins at fertilization</strong> when an oocyte (ovum) from a female is fertilized by a sperm (spermatozoon) from a male.[4]</blockquote>

<h3>4. Ronan O'Rahilly and Fabiola Müller, <em>Human Embryology and Teratology, 3rd edition</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/yzAqJDI.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>Although life is a continuous process, fertilization (which, incidentally, is not a 'moment') is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, <strong>a new genetically distinct human organism is formed</strong> when the chromosomes of the male and female pronuclei blend in the oocyte.[5]</blockquote>

<h2>Other texts that teach life begins at conception and fertilization</h2>

<h3>5. William J. Larsen, <em>Essentials of Human Embryology</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/nIyy0z7.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>Human embryos begin development following the fusion of definitive male and female gametes during fertilization... This moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.[6]</blockquote>

<h3>6. Bradley M. Patten, <em>Patten's Foundations of Embryology, 6th edition</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/DWIiU6Y.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>The time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or <em>ontogeny</em>, of the individual.[7]</blockquote>

<h3>7. Bradley M. Patten, <em>Human Embryology: Elements of Clinical Development</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/Jr8oP6o.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoan and the resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitutes the culmination of the process of fertilization and <strong>marks the initiation of the life of a new individual</strong>.[8]</blockquote>

<h3>8. J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, <em>Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/U1UxI92.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>The term conception refers to the union of the male and female pronuclear elements of procreation from which a new living being develops.[9]</blockquote>

<blockquote>The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life.[10]</blockquote>

<h3>9. E.L. Potter and J.M. Craig, <em>Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3rd edition</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/3V3HFJi.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition.[11]</blockquote>

<h3>10. Geraldine Lux Flanagan, <em>Beginning of Life</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/djVOBrT.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>Every baby begins life within the tiny globe of the mother's egg... It is beautifully translucent and fragile and it encompasses the vital links in which life is carried from one generation to the next. Within this tiny sphere great events take place. <strong>When one of the father's sperm cells, like the ones gathered here around the egg, succeeds in penetrating the egg and becomes united with it, a new life can begin.</strong>[12]</blockquote>

<h3>11. National Geographic, <em>The Biology of Prenatal Development</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/RuqgY3N.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>Biologically speaking, human development begins at fertilization.[13]</blockquote>

<h3>12. National Geographic, <em>In the Womb</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/AlPM0ug.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>The two cells gradually and gracefully become one. <strong>This is the moment of conception, when an individual's unique set of DNA is created, a human signature that never existed before and will never be repeated.</strong>[14]</blockquote>

<h3>13. Louis Fridhandler, "Gametogenesis to Implantation," <em>Biology of Gestation</em>, vol. 1</h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/3C6hNGE.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>Fertilization is "that wondrous moment that <strong>marks the beginning of life for a new unique individual.</strong>[15]"</blockquote>

<h3>14. <em>Time</em> and Rand McNally, <em>Atlas of the Body</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/8QavsV5.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote>In fusing together, the male and female gametes produce a fertilized single cell, the zygote, which is <strong>the start of a new individual</strong>.[16]</blockquote>

<h3>15. "Pregnancy," <em>New Encyclopedia Britannica</em></h3>

<img class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/oVKfVh3.jpg" style="float:right" />

<blockquote><strong>A new individual is created</strong> when the elements of a potent sperm merge with those of a fertile ovum, or egg.[17]</blockquote>
