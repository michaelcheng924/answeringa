<h2>The assertion</h2>
<p>In in article in one of its printed publications, NARAL asserts that “Personhood at conception is a religious belief, not a provable biological fact.”[1]</p>

<h2>The answer</h2>

<p>The truth is that <strong>science is clear and overwhelmingly consistent in affirming that human life begins at conception and fertilization</strong>.</p>

<p>Below are 24 scientific sources, most of which are secular and non-biased, that teach that life begins at fertilization/conception.</p>

<h2><a href="#answer-4-top" id="answer-4">^</a> Expert medical testimony that life begins at conception and fertilization</h2>

<p>In 1981, a United States judiciary subcommittee invited experts to testify on when life beings.[18]</p>

<h3>16. Dr. Alfred M. Bongioanni, professor of pediatrics and obstetrics at the University of Pennsylvania</h3>

<p>I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception... I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human life... I am no more prepared to say that these early stages [of development in the womb] represent an incomplete human being than I would be to say that the child prior to the dramatic effects of puberty... is not a human being. This is human life at every stage.</p>

<h3>17. Dr. Jerome Lejeune, professor of genetics at the University of Descartes in Paris, the discoverer of the chromosome pattern of Down syndrome.</h3>

<p>After fertilization has taken place, a new human being has come into being... [This] is no longer a matter of taste or opinion... [this is] not a metaphysical contention; it is plain experimental evidence... Each individual has a very neat beginning, at conception.</p>

<h3>18. Professor Hymie Gordon, Mayo Clinic</h3>

<p>By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.</p>

<h3>Professor Micheline Matthews-Roth, Harvard University Medical School</h3>

<p>It is incorrect to say that biological data cannot be decisive... It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception... Our laws, one function of which is to help preserve the lives of our people, should be based on accurate scientific data.</p>

<h3>19. Dr. Watson A. Bowes, University of Colorado Medical School</h3>

<p>The beginning of a single human life is from a biological point of view a simple and straightforward matter&mdash;the beginning is conception. This straightfoward biological fact should not be distorted to serve sociological, political, or economic goals.</p>

<h3>No pro-abortion testimony</h3>

<p>One prominent physician points out the following concerning these senate hearings:</p>

<p>Pro-abortionists, though invited to do so, did not produce even a single export witness who would specifically testify that life begins at any point other than conception or implantation. Only one witness said no one can tell when life begins.[19]</p>

<h2><a href="#answer-5-top" id="answer-5">^</a> Scientists and physicians affirm that life begins at conception and fertilization</h2>

<h3>20. Ashley Montague, geneticist and professor at Harvard and Rutgers</h3>

<p>Montague is unsympathetic to the prolife cause, yet affirms the following:</p>

<blockquote>The basic fact of life is simple: <strong>life begins not at birth, but conception.</strong>[20]</blockquote>

<h3>21. Dr. Bernard Nathanson, internationally known obstetrician and gynecologist</h3>

<p>Nathanson was a cofounder of NARAL (the National Abortion Rights Action League). He was the owner and director of the largest abortion clinic in the western hemisphere at the time. His clinic conducted over 60,000 abortions.</p>

<p>However, after continuing to study the science of fetology and using ultrasound to observe unborn children in the womb, Nathanson concluded that he had been very mistaken about his view of abortion. He resigned from his position and wrote in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> that he was deeply troubled by his "increasing certainty that I had in fact presided over 60,000 deaths."[21]</p>

<p>After this, Nathanson produced a film called <em>The Silent Scream</em>, where he says the following:</p>

<blockquote>Modern technologies have convinced us that <strong>beyond question the unborn child is simply another human being</strong>, another member of the human community, indistinguishable in every way from any of us.</blockquote>

<p>Then, Nathanson wrote <em>Aborting America</em> to teach the public about the truth concerning the abortion rights movement, of which he had been a primary leader.[22]</p>

<p>Nathanson did all of this while he was still an atheist, and his conclusions were not based upon religion, but rather purely upon biological facts.</p>

<h3>22. Dr. Landrum Shettles</h3>

<p>Shettles was an attending obstetrician gynecologist for 27 years at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. He was a pioneer in sperm biology, fertility, and sterility, and he is internationally famous for discovering male and female-producing sperm. His intrauterine photographs of preborn children appear in over 50 medical textbooks. Dr. Shettles says the following concerning abortion:</p>

<blockquote>I oppose abortion. I do so, first, because I accept what is biologically manifest&mdash;<strong>that human life commences at the time of conception</strong>&mdash;and, second, because I believe it is wrong to take innocent human life under any circumstance. My position is scientific, pragmatic, and humanitarian.[23]</blockquote>

<h3>23. The First International Symposium on Abortion</h3>

<p>This symposium came to the following conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>The changes occuring between implantation, a six-week embryo, a six-month fetus, a one-week-old child, or a mature adult are merely stages of development and maturation. The majority of our group could find no point in time between the union of sperm and egg, or at least the blastocyst stage, and the birth of the infant at which point we could say that this was not a human life.[24]</blockquote>

<h3>24. The official Senate report on Senate Bill 158, the "Human Life Bill"</h3>

<p>This report summarized the issue this way:</p>

<blockquote>Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that <strong>conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being</strong>&mdash;being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings.[25]</blockquote>
